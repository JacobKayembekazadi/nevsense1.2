# Product Requirements Document: Document E-Signature Integration

## Feature Name
Document E-Signature Integration

## Problem Statement
Currently, users can generate and download accessibility and UX reports as PDFs, but there is no way to electronically sign these documents within the NavSense AIâ„¢ platform. This creates friction for workflows that require formal sign-off, approval, or compliance verification, forcing users to rely on external tools for e-signatures. Integrating e-signature functionality will streamline the process, improve user experience, and enhance the value of the platform for associations and their stakeholders.

## User Stories
- As an association manager, I want to electronically sign the generated PDF report so that I can formally approve the findings and recommendations.
- As a consultant, I want to request signatures from multiple stakeholders on a report, so that all required parties can sign off before proceeding.
- As a user, I want to view the signature status of a report, so I know if all required signatures have been collected.
- As a user, I want to download or share a signed version of the report for compliance and record-keeping.

## Functional Requirements
1. Users can add one or more signature fields to a generated PDF report.
2. Users can sign the report using a mouse, touchscreen, or by uploading a signature image.
3. Users can invite others (via email) to sign the report.
4. The system tracks which users have signed and which are pending.
5. Once all required signatures are collected, the signed PDF can be downloaded or shared.
6. The signature process must be secure and tamper-evident (e.g., signatures are cryptographically bound to the document).
7. The UI must clearly indicate signature status and provide feedback on successful/failed signing actions.
8. All e-signature actions must be logged for audit purposes (if/when a backend is available).

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Security:** Signatures must be securely stored and bound to the document; API keys and user data must be protected.
- **Performance:** Adding and signing documents should not noticeably degrade app performance.
- **Accessibility:** All signature workflows must be accessible (keyboard navigation, screen reader support, color contrast, etc.).
- **Compliance:** E-signatures must meet legal standards (e.g., ESIGN Act, eIDAS) where applicable.
- **Scalability:** The solution should be designed to support future backend integration for audit trails and advanced workflows.

## Out of Scope (for MVP)
- Integration with third-party e-signature providers (e.g., DocuSign, Adobe Sign)
- Advanced identity verification (e.g., KYC, SMS/email OTP)
- Backend storage of signed documents and audit logs (unless backend is added)
- Mobile app-specific optimizations
- Bulk signature requests or workflow automation

## Success Metrics
- 80%+ of users who generate a report use the e-signature feature within the first month
- 95%+ signature completion rate for initiated signature requests
- <2% user-reported issues with signature accuracy, security, or accessibility
- Positive qualitative feedback from users on the ease and value of the e-signature workflow
- No security or compliance incidents related to e-signature data

*This PRD is based on the current architecture described in architectural_document.md. For MVP, all logic will remain client-side unless a backend is introduced in the future.*
